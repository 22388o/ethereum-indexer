"""
We use formal interfaces to enforce **modularity** first and foremost, and then structure
onto all of the code that is to be written.

About transform implicit assumptions:

You specify which transformers to use from the transformers
directory. Each transformer must sit in its separate folder and
must include a main.py file that describes the handlers for the
events. There also must be a config file in that directory.

Name your files such that there is a part that gives your
transformer recognisable slug and a part that versions them.

Only those transformers that are specified by the user will be
used (i.e. not all of the transformers will be used).

Example:

src
 |
 |transformers
 |  |
 |  |rumble-kong-league-0.0.1
 |  |  |
 |  |  |main.py
 |  |  |config.json
 |  |  |

Where ``config.json`` looks like

And ``main.py`` looks like
